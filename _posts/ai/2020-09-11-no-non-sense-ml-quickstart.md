# No non-sense ML quickstart

It is important to get started quickly, get your hands dirty...when you want to learn something, especially code/technologies/frameworks.

So, here is a no non-sense quickstart for ML using Python, VS Code(IDE), Anaconda(Distro). Lets also use Jupyter Notebooks which also comes with the Python extension for VS Code.

**Why VS Code?** Lightweight, Free(for both Individual and Professional use at the time of writing this), (most) popular among python users, cross-platform, very good support for python and python for data science.

**Why Anaconda?** It is a distro that comes with the most popular AI/ML/Data Science dependencies or packages. You can learn these details later, don't let it delay you.

**Why Jupyter Notebooks?** Helps you divide your Python code into cells and run/debug them individually. Very useful when processing large data sets.

# Lets get started:
* Install VS Code. Simple .exe or .dmg download and execution from the Microsoft site with all defaults.
* Install Anaconda. Download [installer](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/) and run it with all the defaults.
* Open VS code, on the left pane you should see the Extensions button, click on it, type Pyhon in the search bar. Install the one from Microsoft.

* Thats it for the setup. Now lets run the most popular and simple ML exercise -
