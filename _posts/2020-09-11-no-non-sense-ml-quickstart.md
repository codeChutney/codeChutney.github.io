title: No non-sense ML quickstart
---

It is important to get started quickly, get your hands dirty...when you want to learn something especially code/technologies/frameworks.

So, here is a no non-sense quickstart for ML using Python, VS Code(IDE), Anaconda(Distro). Lets also use Jupyter Notebooks which also comes with the Python extension for VS Code.

**Why VS Code?** Lightweight, Free(for both Individual and Professional use at the time of writing this), (most) popular among python users, cross-platform, very good support for python and python for data science.

**Why Anaconda?** It is a distro that comes with the most popular AI/ML/Data Science dependencies or packages. You can learn these details later, don't let it delay you.

**Why Jupyter Notebooks?** Helps you divide your Python code into cells and run/debug them individually. Very useful when processing large data sets.

# Lets get started:
1.  Install VS Code. Simple .exe or .dmg download and execution from the microsoft site with all defaults.
2.  Install Anaconda. Download [installer](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/) from here and run it with all the defaults.
3. Open VS code, on the left pane you should see the Extensions button, click on it, type Pyhon in the search bar. Install the one from Microsoft, it will also have a green star in the top right part.
