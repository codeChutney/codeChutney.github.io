Here is a quick list of things i have learnt, documneting them here as almost all other resources i have seen are TL;DR..

A lot of these are picked from the tweet by Randall Kanna in the references section. 

1. Recruiters still prefer classis fonts - Times New Roman, Calibri.
2. Size: > 10.5 and <12.
3. DRY - Don't repeat yourself. Try not to repeat words either.
4. Run it through [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/). 
5. Run it through a scanner, so that you can beat an ATS(applicant tracking systems) - https://resumeworded.com/resume-scanner.
6.
