# Simple tips for building an effective resume

Here is a quick list of things i have learnt, documeting them here as almost all other resources i have seen are TL;DR..

A lot of these are picked from the tweet by Randall Kanna in the references section. 

1. Recruiters still prefer classic fonts - Times New Roman, Calibri.
2. Font size: > 10.5 and <12.
3. DRY - Don't repeat yourself. Try not to repeat words either.
4. Run it through [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/). 
5. Run it through a [scanner](https://resumeworded.com/resume-scanner), so that you can beat an ATS(applicant tracking systems).
6.  Add page numbers.
7. Make sure To have your name on every page.
8. Include a Skills list so that you beat whatever keyword scanner the company might be using. Example:

```
Here is an example of what a skills list should look like:

Expert: C#, C/C++, VB.NET, ASP.NET, HTML, CSS, SQL, REST, SOAP

Intermediate: Java, J2EE, Spring, Hibernate, JDBC, Eclipse, Jenkins, Hudson

Learning: Python, Ruby on Rails
```
